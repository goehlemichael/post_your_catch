catch model crud

users need to register to post catches

Need to determine business model:

will buyers need to subscribe/register to view listings.
Will the site take a cut of every transaction (like ebay)
Will certain listings be prioritized (like craigslist)

List table of all catches (fish type, when it was posted, amount, contact information, etc.)

automatically remove catches after a day or so (to be determined on actual duration)

add views for:

'forgot password', 'change password', 'reset password', 'send confirmation' and 'send login'
