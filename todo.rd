catch model crud

users need to register to post catches

Need to determine business model:

will buyers need to subscribe/register to view listings.
Will the site take a cut of every transaction(like ebay)
Will certain listings be prioritized(like craigslist)

List table of all catches (fish type, when it was posted, amount, contact information)

automatically remove catches after a day or so (to be determined)
